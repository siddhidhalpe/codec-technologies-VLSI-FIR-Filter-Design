Abstract

This project implements a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter using Verilog HDL. FIR filters are widely used in DSP applications due to their stability and linear phase response.

Introduction

Digital filters are essential in signal processing. FIR filters are preferred for applications requiring precise phase characteristics.

Tools & Methodology
